# SQL-Queries
This repository showcases my ability to explore and analyze data across databases using SQL query techniques.

I utilized various SQL query techniques to explore and analyze data across five distinct databases, demonstrating proficiency in complex queries, joins, subqueries, and data manipulation.

These projects were part of my studies at Purdue Global.
